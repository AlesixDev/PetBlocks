The pet falls through the ground when riding?
=============================================

Sometimes the pet is not synchronized with your world or simply requires another hitbox-height for
your server version. Simply play around with the following config option until it fits you.

**config.yml**
::
 pet:
  follow:
    running-hitbox-height: -1.5
