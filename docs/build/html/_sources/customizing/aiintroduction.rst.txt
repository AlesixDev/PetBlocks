Introduction to the ai system
=============================

The idea behind of the ai system is to let you, the owner of the server, craft a highly customizable pet
with custom behaviour which perfectly fits your server environment.

Brainstorming ideas can be:

* Combat pets
* Pets with health
* Pets which can be feed
* Fast travel pets
* Transport pets
* Flying pets
* Custom models on pets
* etc.

There are tons of possibilities and actions can be chained by using the GUI other /petblocks ai <path> command.
