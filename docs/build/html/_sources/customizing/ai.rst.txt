AIS
===

The articles in this section explain how to use and customize the ais in PetBlocks.
Make sure you have read the `introduction to PetBlocks <../pets/index.html>`_ first.

.. note::
    The idea behind of the ai system is to let you, the owner of the server, craft a highly customizable pet
    with custom behaviour which perfectly fits your server environment.
