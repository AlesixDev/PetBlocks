Wearing
=======

The AI called "Wearing" is a behaviour ai which lets the pet ride on the head of the player.

Once the Wearing ai is applied, it gets executed at a higher priority than any other ai and partially blocks them while it
is being active.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This ai is a **event based ai**, therefore this ai will always be active once applied.
