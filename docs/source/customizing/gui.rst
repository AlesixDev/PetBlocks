.. note:: PetBlocks **does not** offer a **shop system** in the GUI because this is not a focus of the plugin. However, you can hide or block certain actions in the PetBlocks GUI if a user does not have sufficient permissions. The permissions can be defined by yourself and sold via **any external permission shop plugin**.
