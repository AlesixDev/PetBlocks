Setting up pets for your server
===============================

Congrats you are now ready to try the default pets for the first time. Start your server, type **/petblock** in the chat and click on the red traffic light
icon in the center of the GUI.

Of course, there might be issues to the other plugins or other settings which can cause issues. Simply check out the `FAQ <../faq/index.html>`_.

Once you have confirmed that your pet **successfully can spawn in the world and region** your player is standing in, you can continue with
customizing the default pet.
