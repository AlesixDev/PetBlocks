The pet falls through the ground when riding?
=============================================

Sometimes the pet is not synchronized with your world or simply requires another hitbox for
your server version. Play around with the offset-y value of the riding ai.

**config.yml**
::
  type: 'ground-riding'
  climbing-height: 1.0
  speed: 2.0
  offset-y: -1
