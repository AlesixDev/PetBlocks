## HOW TO COMBIND PETBLX WITH YOUR CUSTOM PACK ##
##+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++##
##
## This is very simple, just unzip the pack and locate the 2 "nubx" folders.
## one is located in minecraft/textures the other is located in minecraft/models/items.
## Now that you have the 2 "nubx" folders located. Open your custom pack and drop the
## 2 "nubx" folders into the same place they came from in the petblx resource pack.
## So you need to drop the "nubx" folder from textures into your textures folder of your custom pack.
## You also need to drop the "nubx" folder from items into your custom packs items folder.
## There is one final step. Drop the "stone_hoe.json" into your models/item folder.
##
## Note: If you have custom models that replace the "stone_hoe.json" you may need to adjust
## the inside of that file manually.
