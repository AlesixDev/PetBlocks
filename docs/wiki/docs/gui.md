# GUI

PetBlocks does no longer have its own GUI, because PetBlocks wants to focus on being a pet plugin instead of a GUI plugin. 

There are many very good GUI plugins outthere. One popular example is DeluxeMenu. PetBlocks distributes a pre-made DeluxeMenu GUI, to get
the old PetBlocks GUI back. 

### Installing the classic PetBlocks GUI

* Install DeluxeMenu
* Install PlaceHolderApi
* Copy the contents from the ``plugins/PetBlocks/thirdparty/DeluxeMenu`` folder to the ``plugins/DeluxeMenu`` folder. Restart the server. Execute ``/petblocksmenu``
  with the permission ``petblocks.deluxemenu``.
