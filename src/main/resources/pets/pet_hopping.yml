# Pet settings
pet:
  # The initial name of the pet shown above the pet on first spawn. Supports ChatColors.
  displayName: "%petblocks_owner_name%'s pet"
  # The initial visibility the pet starts with on first spawn.
  # Should the pet be shown to all players (e.g. "ALL") or shown to just the owner (e.g. "OWNER")?
  visibility: "ALL"
  # The initial loop state the pet starts with on first spawn.
  loop: "idle"
  # Should the pet immediately spawn after creation with the /petblocks create command?
  isSpawned: true
  # Should the player immediately ride on the pet on initial spawn?
  # Possible values "NO", "GROUND", "HAT"
  ridingState: "NO"
  # All item properties.

    # TypeName the pet is represented. For version compatibility, multiple identifiers can be added by separating with a comma.

  physics:
    # The amount of acceleration in minus y axe direction which is applied after each tick.
    gravity: 0.05
    # If a velocity is applied to the pet, this is the percentage of the speed the pet preserves after each tick.
    # e.g. 1.0 = Pet continuous to fly with the same speed into infinity.
    # e.g. 0.8 = Pet speed is reduced to 80% of its previous value after each tick.
    relativeVelocityReduce: 0.8
    # If a velocity is applied to the pet, this is the absolute value which is taken from the velocity speed vector after each tick.
    # e.g. 0.005 means that the speed is reduced by 0.005 after each tick
    absoluteVelocityReduce: 0.0005
